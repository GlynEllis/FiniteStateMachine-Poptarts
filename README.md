# FiniteStateMachine-Poptarts
FSM based upon a pop tart vending machine.

A finite state machine that was created to fit the diagram showns in the screenshot. It allows for a user to make a selection on the pop tart base and the filling using option codes. Bitmasking was used to store multiple options under a single value.
